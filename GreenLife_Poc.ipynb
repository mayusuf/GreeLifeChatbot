            "* **Time management techniques:** Explore techniques like the Pomodoro Technique (working in focused bursts with short breaks) to improve concentration and prevent burnout.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Stress reduction techniques:**  Incorporate stress-reducing activities into your daily routine. This could include exercise, meditation, spending time in nature, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy.  Even short breaks for deep breathing can make a difference.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Seek professional help:** If these strategies don't help, or if the feeling of overwhelm persists, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you identify the root cause of your stress and develop coping mechanisms.  They can also rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms.\n",
